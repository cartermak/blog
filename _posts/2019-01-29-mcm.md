# The **What**

> What exactly is the Mathematical Contest in Modeling?

Every year, the Consortium on Mathematics and its Applications (COMAP) hosts a global contest "where teams of undergraduates use mathematical modeling to present their solutions to real world problems." The contest consists of a 100-hour window that starts off with COMAP releasing 6 problems. Each team picks a problem, models the most creative and intelligent solution they can, and submits a written report summarizing their response.

# The **Why**

> Why on Earth would I do this?

I don't have a pragmatic answer to this question. The reality is that I have no good reason to drop all other obligations for 100 hours in the middle of the semester other than because it's a fun challenge. Committing to the MCM means committing to forfeit sleep, school, and sanity for over four straight days in favor of being locked in a room with a couple other people, coding and puzzling and researching the days and nights away. If that sounds awful, I hear you. If that sounds like a blast, maybe you should check the MCM out.

# The **How**

> How do I prepare?

I suppose you could participate in the MCM in your off-hours for a few days while trying to continue your day-to-day functions, but I'd argue that if you're going to try the MCM, you should go all-in. This means completing assignments *days* in advance (this was a very foreign concept to me), talking to professors and instructors about missing class, and telling your family that you love them before disappearing for a bit.

You'll need a good place to work, eat, and sleep (ideally all in close proximity!). In my case, my partners and I moved three desks into a dorm room, loaded up our computers, and planned a few take-out meals to save us some time. In the moment, it felt ridiculous, but in hindsight, it really felt like a quintessential college experience.

# The **Who**

> Who do I recruit to do this thing?

I'm going to be frank---spending four days straight trying to work with one or two other people can build some tension. It's important to pick partners who you've worked with on a project before, who are as committed as you are, and with whom you generally understand and agree. It's frustrating to realize that your best friend is a horrible work partner. A 100 hour contest is not a fun time to come to that realization. 

# My Experience

Alright, enough beating around the bush. Here's how it went for me.

## Getting Started

I spent the week leading up to the contest pulling late-night study sessions to make sure I was ahead enough in classes to step away for four days without coming back to a dumpster-fire of an academic life. That meant that going in, I was pretty tired. That wasn't a great start.

When the contest opened, my partners and I read through the six problems. We deliberated and narrowed down to a choice between two: the first choice posed the problem of planning drone-based medical supply delivery to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017, while the second choice challenged teams to model opioid epidemic spread. I wasn't particularly entranced by the idea of solving either, but we eventually settled on the first.

## Constructing our Solution

I'm going to be blunt: I thought that my teammates and I would come up with some mathematically complex, holistic solution to whatever problem we chose. In reality, I think our solution was pretty uninspiring. I implemented some basic regression modeling and interpolated some performance statistics for the drones and used that to optimize the drop locations for resources, as well as built some image processing to use maps to identify population centers and roads. One of my teammates built a neat brute-force packing algorithm to maximize the amount of equipment we could fit in a set of standard shipping containers. That was neat, but at the time, it didn't feel particularly groundbreaking.

## Writing the Report

The one area where we did exceed my expectations was our report. I feared turing in a jumbled mess of mis-placed figures and misspellings, but I was very pleased with the 23 pages we turned in. Writing in LaTeX definitely helped us make an aesthetically pleasing document, but I'm primarily glad we stopped modeling when we did in order to dedicate enough time to write up a well-organized and intelligible report. We worked hard to reduce our work to an informative set of figures and tables, and I'll pat myself on the back---I think we did a pretty good job of it.

## The Results

I was definitely surprised to find out how our team placed. We earned an Honorable Mention, which places us in the top 15% of the 14,000+ international teams who participated. Not bad for three freshmen, eh?

We even got a cute certificate out of it:

</div>

## The Toll

If I was tired going into the contest, I was on the verge of breaking coming out. Once the adrenaline high of our final submission wore off, the exhaustion hit and I'm sure I slept more in the night after the contest than I did during the entire contest itself. I consumed an awful amount of coffee, espresso, and Red Bull, not to mention eating pretty mediocre food the entire time (pizza, burrito, pizza, burrito...). Seeing the glass half full, I suppose you could let that speak to my dedication and resolve. Realistically, that 100 hours took a toll on me because I really threw self care out the window. 

# Next Time

Will there be a next time? Probably not. The MCM was fun and difficult and fulfilling and exhausting. Weighing the good versus the bad, I think the novelty of it all made the first experience worth it. That being said, I'd rather wear myself out on doing something else new and exciting instead of doing it all over again.
