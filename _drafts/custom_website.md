title: Making a Static Website (Affordably!)
categories: projects

## Motivation

I spend so much time tinkering with little side projects. What I really need is a solid repository where I can document and write about these projects

As a member of the [Engineering Honors Program](https://cuengineeringhonors.com/) at CU Boulder, I need to create and manage an ePortfolio website. That being said, a personal website could also serve as something I've been considering for a while: a repository where I can document and write about all the little projects I love to work on but can't seem to keep track of. 

That's what this website is for:

<!-- Revise this: -->
1. Satisfy the requirements of EHP
1. Record all of my projects

## Overview

<!-- Section outline: -->

- Custom domain name
- Static website (don't need anything more)
- Budget (cheap >> gh-pages)
- GH-pages, Jekyll, Markdown (already know), etc.
